## What I Do

I build backend systems that are fast, reliable, and built to scale. Most of my work is in Go, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and I’m especially into streaming and VOD platforms things like media processing workflows, ad insertion, and making sure everything holds up under load.

I enjoy owning the full lifecycle: coding, shipping, and running it in production. Infrastructure is just as fun for me as application logic: Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Proxmox, CI/CD, monitoring, cloud or bare metal. If it involves building, automating, and making systems run smoothly, I’m in.

Currently, I'm working at **[NBCUniversal](https://www.nbcuniversal.com/) | [Sky](https://www.sky.com/)**, where I develop backend API services, scalable video transcode pipelines, and server-side/client-side ad insertion for both live and VOD content which is available in 100+ countries, and handling **millions** of requests per day.
